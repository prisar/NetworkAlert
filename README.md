# NetworkAlert
Android App to detect change in Internet connectivity and put an alarm

# Use Case
I came across this use case when I was using an app to watch some videos to earn some coins. So, I decided that it would be good that if the app is always open and runs those videos with out manual intervation. But, problem occured when sometimes the network connection or WIFI conectivity goes off. And the videos stops playing. Which means I would need some alarm to ring when the videos stops playing due to no internet connection. And this app is the result of the demand.
If you are looking for something like this, then this app which serve your purpose.
